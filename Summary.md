To summarize the findings with the provided data after calculating the final tumor volumes for each mouse across the four treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), we can follow these steps:

Final Tumor Volumes: We have identified the final tumor volumes for each mouse by using the last recorded timepoint for each mouse in the study.
Descriptive Statistics: We can calculate descriptive statistics for the tumor volumes of each treatment regimen, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM.
Potential Outliers: We can identify potential outliers in the tumor volumes for each treatment regimen using the IQR method.
Here is a more detailed summary based on these steps:

Final Tumor Volumes:
We obtained the final tumor volumes for each mouse by identifying the greatest timepoint for each mouse and merging this information back with the original dataset.
This allowed us to isolate the tumor volume at the last recorded timepoint for each mouse in the study.
Descriptive Statistics:
For each treatment regimen (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), we calculated the following statistics:
Mean: The average final tumor volume.
Median: The middle value of the final tumor volumes.
Variance: The measure of the spread of the final tumor volumes.
Standard Deviation: The average distance of the final tumor volumes from the mean.
SEM (Standard Error of the Mean): The standard deviation of the sample mean estimate.
